The Heat Tracking System for Seat Vehicles is able to keep the heat on vehicle seats. The temperature is quite low in European nations and every electrical designer must ensure that their equipment works well. The sensor will feel in our project if the driver is sitting or not. If the driver is sitting then he has to regulate the temperature properly. Our controller is based on the necessary temperature for the heater. The heater generates the heat and the required temperature is displayed on an LCD monitor. We utilised a microcontroller, together with the temperature sensor, push button, heat generator, LED and LCD, etc. In our project.
