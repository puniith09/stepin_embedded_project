# Requirements
## Introduction
This project is used to identify passenger sitting and to increase the temperature in colder places, where the temperature is lower and the temperature may be set when the passenger takes the seat and then the heater is on and off. Driving may be one of the most soothing or stressful things to do. And weather is one of the variables that contributes to this. It gets too hot or too chilly sometimes since you don't actually have your air conditioning system. You feel uncomfortable gradually, but you must continue to drive, because your goal is far away. The vehicle seat heating was used to aid drivers or even passagers enjoy their trip to help resolve this issue, in particular on a chilly night. These vehicle heaters keep you warm and toasty during extraordinarily cold nights to keep you warm. You only have to put them in your vehicle seat.

### Strengths

Friendly to the user Temperature value may be easily changed As modular programmes, the system is resilient and affordable.

### Weakness

This applies exclusively to those nations that have low temperatures.

### Opportunities

The heater and air conditioners may be added to aid all the countries. It can be done.

### Threats

Not appropriate for the area with medium and high temperatures.
