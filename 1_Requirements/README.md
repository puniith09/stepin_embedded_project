# Requirements
## Introduction
This project is used to identify passenger sitting and to increase the temperature in colder places, where the temperature is lower and the temperature may be set when the passenger takes the seat and then the heater is on and off.

## Objectives

* Detection of the passenger
* Enabling Heater
* Temperature setting

## Used components

* Temperature sensor
* switches
* display
* led for indication
* potential Switch
* resister

## Features

* Changing temperature
* Detect the passenger
* Display the temperature
* Enable the heater

## Strengths

Friendly to the user Temperature value may be easily changed As modular programmes, the system is resilient and affordable.

### Weakness

This applies exclusively to those nations that have low temperatures.

## Opportunities

The heater and air conditioners may be added to aid all the countries. It can be done.

## Threats

Not appropriate for the area with medium and high temperatures.
